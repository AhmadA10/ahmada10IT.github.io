   <h1>This is the GREATEST Website Ever and I am a little excited that you are here</h1>
    <p> My name is Ahmad Ali. I live in New Jersey and I am a first-year college student. I am excited to start my college journey and work hard to get my degree. I work at a mall and I like spending time with family and friends. </p>
    <p> My favorite show of all time is Prison Break and Breaking Bad. Some of my hobbies are playing sports and watching movies. I also love alfredo pasta, sushi, and other food. I am Pakistani and part Chinese which is pretty cool. </p>
